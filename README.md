# connect-4-game
Springboard assignment creating a simple connect 4 game with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Connect Four is played on a grid, 7 wide by 6 deep, with two players, 1 (red) and 2 (yellow). The players alternate turns, dropping a piece of their color in the top of a column. The piece will fall down to the further-down unoccupied slot.

The game is won when a player makes four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game is a tie if the entire board fills up without a winner.
